title: RPC system rewritten to use async I/O
author: dwrensha
---


Today I've released
verson 0.6 of the three main Cap'n Proto crates:
the [runtime](https://crates.io/crates/capnp/),
the [code generator](https://crates.io/crates/capnpc/),
and the [remote procedure call system](https://crates.io/crates/capnp-rpc/).

The biggest change is that the RPC system
is now asynchronous, built on top of the [GJ](https://crates.io/crates/gj/)
event loop library.

### promises

[Cap'n Proto's RPC protocol](https://capnproto.org/rpc.html)
allows method calls to be made on distributed objects.
It has a built-in notion of pipelining that can minimize network round-trips,
and it allows object references to be
transmitted within messages, alongside plain-old-data.

Such a system has an inherent need
to deal with concurrency,
both in its internal implementation in its publicly-exposed interfaces.

For example, it's common for a user to want to implement an
RPC method that makes a bunch of other RPC calls
and then collects their results
before returning.
How should these actions compose?
In the new version of `capnp-rpc`,
which uses GJ's [`Promise`](https://docs.rs/gj/0.2.0/gj/struct.Promise.html) abstraction,
each of the inner method calls
returns a promise,
and those promises can be collected with `Promise::all()`
to form a new promise which can then be returned from the outer method.

To see more concretely what this kind of thing looks like,
take a look at the
[calculator example](https://github.com/dwrensha/capnp-rpc-rust/tree/master/examples/calculator),
which also showcases some fancier features.
There are also some more-practical examples
in the form of [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io) apps:
a simple [GET/PUT/DELETE server](https://github.com/dwrensha/sandstorm-rawapi-example-rust)
and a [word game](https://github.com/dwrensha/acronymy).

### error handling

A `Promise<T, E>` is essentially a deferred `Result<T, E>`,
so it should be no surprise that
today's release pertains to
our [continuing]({{site.baseurl}}/2014/04/06/error-handling.html)
[story]({{site.baseurl}}/2015/03/21/error-handling-revisited.html)
about error handling.

Last time, we described our switch to using `Result<T,E>` pervasively,
so that we could return an `Err(e)` on a decode error,
rather than panicking.
That switch had some costs:

 1. We now need to sprinkle `try!()`s in our code, one for any time we dereference a Cap'n Proto pointer.
 2. We also need to edit some return types from `T` to `Result<T, E>`,
    and in some cases need to define helper functions so that `try!()` has a place to return to.

In my opinion, (1) is not so bad, and it has the advantage of making control flow more clear.
The [proposed `?` operator](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/243)
would make this even nicer.

In the asynchronous world of Cap'n Proto RPC,
(2) becomes less of a hassle, because
most functions that need to read a Cap'n Proto message
are asynchronous, and therefore already return a `Promise<T, E>`.
In such cases, we can use the [`pry!()`](https://docs.rs/gj/0.2.0/gj/macro.pry!.html)
macro that GJ defines. The `pry!()` macro acts like `try!()`, but in the early return case returns
`Promise::err(e)` rather than `Result::Err(e)`.

### a simpler error type

One error-related question that often arises when designing interfaces that use `Promise<T,E>` is:
what concrete error type should be plugged in for `E`?

In previous versions of capnproto-rust, I had defined an error enum `capnp::Error`
with various cases, one of which wrapped a `std::io::Error`.
This got me into trouble when I wanted to start using
[`Promise::fork()`](https://docs.rs/gj/0.2.0/gj/struct.Promise.html#method.fork),
which requires that `E` be [`Clone`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/clone/trait.Clone.html).
The problem is that `std::io::Error` is not `Clone`!

To address this problem, I have redefined `::capnp::Error` to follow the design of
[kj::Exception](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/capnproto/blob/master/c%2B%2B/src/kj/exception.h).
It's now a very simple struct with a `String` description and an `ErrorKind` enum,
where the only variants of
`ErrorKind` are `Failed`, `Disconnected`, `Overloaded`, and `Unimplemented`.
The observation here is that there seems to be very little gained by
defining hierarchies of errors wrapping other errors.
